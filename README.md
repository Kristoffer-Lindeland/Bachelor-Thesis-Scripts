# Bachelor-Thesis-Scripts
This repository contains all the python scripts used in my Bachelor Thesis. This includes scripts used to train the machine learning models, test the models, creation of the GUI, and the scripts used for creating visualizations in the actual report.
In addition the trained model files and the results they produced when tested on the samse subset of the dataset will be available here.
