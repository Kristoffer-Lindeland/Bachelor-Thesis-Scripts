# Bachelor-Thesis-Scripts
This repository contains all the python scripts used in my Bachelor Thesis. This includes scripts used to train the machine learning models, test the models, creation of the GUI, and the scripts used for creating visualizations in the actual report.
In addition the results the models produced when tested on the same subset of the dataset will be available here.
The trained models along with the completed tool will not be here because they were to big to be put on github. Links to them can be found in the repport or in the submission of the Bachelor thesis.
